/**
 * Vitest configuration with a hard 100% coverage gate.
 *
 * Any code under `src` that is reachable in a happy-path environment must be
 * covered by tests. Genuinely-unreachable defensive code (e.g. SSR guards,
 * `process.exit()` paths) can be exempted with a `v8 ignore` annotation
 * accompanied by a one-line reason — never to silence the gate.
 *
 * The thresholds are enforced by CI, so a PR cannot merge while coverage
 * sits below 100% on the activated surface. Playwright e2e specs live in
 * `e2e/` and are outside the vitest scope.
